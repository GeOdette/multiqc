Create a single report with interactive plots for multiple bioinformatics analyses across many samples

    MULTIQC
    ----
 Multiqc workflow implemeents the multiqc tool for creating a single report with interactive plots for multiple bioinformatics analyses across many samples.<br>
 Using the workflow saves on time, installation issues, and provides flexibility in managing your data<br>
 Currently, the tool generates a single report of all files in the input directory provided.<br>
  he workflow does not allow one to ignore files in the single directory. Users are therefore encouraged to carefull curate their folder<br>
    before run.<br>
 However, we are working to ensure such is available in the future

> Note: All results are deposited in the folder multiqc_data while the report in the output directory you selected

Example output:<br>
