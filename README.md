    MULTIQC
    ----
    Multiqc workflow implemeents the multiqc tool for creating a single report with interactive plots for multiple bioinformatics analyses across many samples.<br>
    Using the workflow saves on time, installation issues, and provides flexibility in managing your data<br>

    Currently, the tool generates a single report of all files in the input directory provided.<br>
    The workflow does not allow one to ignore files in the single directory. Users are therefore encouraged to carefull curate their folder<br>
    before run.<br>
    However, we are working to ensure such is available in the future

    > Note: All results are deposited in the folder multiqc_data while the report in the<br>
    output directory you selected

    Example output:<br>
